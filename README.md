Fibonacci Sequence
This project is an in depth analysis of a very common Dynamic Programming problem that many cs majors encounter within the early stages of their tech journey, Fibonacci Sequence.


- The Fibonacci sequence is a recursively defined numerical progression in which each term is computed as the sum of its two immediate predecessors, establishing a well-structured recurrence relation. This formulation inherently exhibits overlapping subproblems, as the computation of higher-indexed terms repeatedly depends on identical lower-indexed subcomputations. It also demonstrates optimal substructure, since the solution to the overall recurrence is optimally derived from the solutions to its constituent subproblems. These properties make the Fibonacci sequence a canonical use case for Dynamic Programming (DP). By leveraging memoization or tabulation, DP transforms the naïve exponential-time recurrence into a deterministic, polynomial-time computation through systematic state caching or iterative state propagation. Moreover, the recurrence can be further optimized using constant-space DP techniques, emphasizing DP’s role in eliminating redundant computations, minimizing time complexity, and enforcing predictable computational constraints within recursive numerical systems.
